# Artificial-intelligence
A collection of short script that implement popular artificial intelligence algorithms (Note: This is a variation of my coursework at Drexel University)

- The first script is built off the 'Rush Hour' game (https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/). It uses breath first search along with A* search to find an optimal solution to the game given a when given a state or using the default set state.

- The second script is built off the 'Connect 4' game (https://shop.hasbro.com/en-us/product/connect-4-game:80FB5BCA-5056- 9047-F5F4-5EB5DF88DAF4). It uses Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning to find the optimal moves in order to win any given game of Connect 4.

- The last script is shows how an AI can use Q-learning to determine the best possible route to a given goal in a given environment.
